3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy

2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
